            <u><h1>What is Graph Theory?</h1></u>

            <p>Graph theory is the study of "Graphs", a collection of vertices (represented by the circles), and edges that join two
                distinct vertices together. The basic idea of this application is to create graphs and use the buttons along the top
                of the page to find out various things about the graph which will be explained below.

                To use the application, you click within the bordered rectangle to add a vertex. Clicking and dragging moves around
                the vertex. Clicking one vertex selects it, and clicking on another, unique vertex adds an edge between the two vertices.
                You will be prompted for an edge weight, which will be used for Prim's algorithm. There are buttons on the left side
                that generate basic graphs, such as complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, or a basic tree.

            <h2>Some notation</h2>
            <div>
                <div>
                    Firstly, a complete graph, writen Kn, is a graph with n vertices in which every vertex connects to every other vertex. 
                    An extension of this is the complete bipartite graph, written Km,n, which has m+n vertices, in which every vertex
                    from the m set connects to every vertex from the n set, and the graph is bipartite (which will be explained later).
                    The degree of each vertex is the total number of edges the vertex has connected to it, or the total number of neighbours
                    the vertex has.

                    Examples of K5 and K3,3 can be found below.

            <h2>Pathing</h2>
            A path between two edges is like a trail that goes along edges to get from one vertex to the other. The length of
            a path is the total number of edges we need to travel across to get to the final vertex. In the application
            the path with the least amount of edges can be found by inputting two vertices numbers spaced out. Such as: "5 7". An
            example of a path from 1 to 5 is given on the graph below:<br>
            <img src="imgs\pathExample.jpg" alt="path" class="longImg"><br>

            <br><br>

            An extension of pathing is connectivity. A graph is connected if every vertex on the graph has a path to a different vertex.
            The image above is a connected graph, but the image below is disconnected:<br>

            <br><br><br>

            <h2>Cycles</h2>
            After paths come cycles! A cycle is referred to as a "closed path". That is, we travel to different vertices and end
            up at the vertex we started on. The length of the cycle is the total number of edges we travel across. The length of the
            smallest cycle in a graph is referred to as the girth of the graph. The girth has more useful properties outside of
            the current application. Below is an example of a graph with a cycle of length 5.<br>
            <img src="imgs\cycleExample.jpg" alt="cycle" class="tallImg">


            <br><br><br>

            <h2>Trees</h2>
            If a graph has no cycles, then it is referred to as a tree! Trees are always connected. If a graph has no cycles but is
            disconnected then it is called a forest. On a tree, vertices have unique paths between each other. Additionally,
            all vertices of degree 1 in a tree are referred to as leaves. Below is an example of a tree:<br>
            <img src="imgs\treeExample.jpg" alt="tree" class="longImg"><br>



            <br><br><br>


            <h2>Bridges</h2>
            A bridge in a graph is an edge that is not apart of any cycles. It would be obvious then that the edges of a tree are
            all bridges, given that a tree will not contain any cycles. An example of a bridge in a graph is given below:<br>
            <img src="imgs\bridgeExample.jpg" alt="bridge" class="longImg"><br>




            <br><br><br>

            <h2>Bipartite</h2>
            We refer to a graph as being bipartite if we can do the following: create two sets of vertices such that every vertex
            in each set never connects to a vertex in the same set. The easiest way to think of this is by saying, make two sets of
            vertices, A and B. The vertices in A must not have a neighbour also in A, and the vertices in B must not have a neighbour in B.
            The application finds these groups for you, if the graph is bipartite. An example of a bipartite graph is given below:<br>
            <img src="imgs\bipartiteExample.jpg" alt="bipartite" class="longImg"><br>




            <br><br><br>

            <h2>Eulerian Circuit</h2>
            We say that a graph has an Eulerian Circuit, if you can start at a single vertex, walk along all edges, and end up back
            at the vertex you started on. Eulerian circuits can only be made on a graph given that the degree of every vertex is even.
            This is because we must both enter then exit a vertex (if we do enter it).




            <br><br><br>

            <h2>Prim's algorithm</h2>
            We have what is called Prim's algorithm. The algorithm finds what is called a "minimum spanning tree", or MST for short.
            An MST can be thought of as connection of edges on the graph that create a tree with every vertex in the graph. But
            additionally, the edges used in this tree have the smallest possible weighted edges, which you add upon creating an edge.
            This algorithm can only be done with a connected graph. Below is an example of an MST in a graph:<br>
            <img src="imgs\mstExample.jpg" alt="mst" class="longImg"><br>




            <br><br><br>


            <h2>Planarity</h2>
            Finally, we have if a graph is planar or not. A graph is planar if you can move the vertices in such a way so the
            edges of the graph never intersect. Otherwise the graph is called nonplanar. K5 and K3,3 are both nonplanar, whereas all trees
            are planar.
            
            This is not fully complete, as the actual algorithm to determine if a graph is planar or not is very inefficient, or much 
            too complicated.
